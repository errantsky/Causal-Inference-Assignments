# Causal-Inference-Assignments

This repo includes my homework assignments for a graduate [Causal Inference](http://sina.sharif.ir/~saleh/CI.pdf) course I took during my B.Sc. Dr. Saber Salehkaleybar instructed this course at the Department of Electrical Engineering at Sharif University of Technology.

All codes are in Python.

Homework 1: Implements the paper ["Nonlinear causal discovery with additive noise models"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2981780.2981866) by Hoyer et al.

Homework 2: Implements the PC algorithm based on ["Estimating High-Dimensional Directed Acyclic Graphs with the PC- Algorithm"](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume8/kalisch07a/kalisch07a.pdf) by Kalisch et al.

Homework 3: Looks into ["Counting and Exploring Sizes of Markov Equivalence Classes of Directed Acyclic Graphs"](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume16/he15a/he15a.pdf) by He et al.
